# **App Name**: Athena AI

## Core Features:

- AI Chatbot: Engage in conversations with an AI chatbot powered by a language model API (OpenAI API / Gemini). The AI uses a tool that reasons when and if to use personal info, summarization and recommendation requests.
- Local Chat History: Store chat history locally (browser localStorage) allowing users to clear or export the chat logs.
- Text and Voice Input: Provide input to the chatbot through text or voice (speech-to-text).
- Voice Responses: Receive responses from the chatbot via text-to-speech.
- Personalized Preferences: Save user preferences locally (theme, language).
- Multilingual Support: Offer multilingual support (English + other languages) with auto-detection.
- Clear Data/Reset: Provide a clear data/reset option in settings to remove all local data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 75%, 50%) - RGB(45, 125, 255). A bright, saturated blue promotes trust, clarity, and focus in a sophisticated way.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - RGB(242, 244, 247). Light and desaturated hue maintains consistency while providing ample contrast for the text.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 65%, 45%) - RGB(60, 190, 180). This analogous cyan increases visual interest without detracting from usability.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, objective, neutral look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a consistent set of minimalist icons throughout the application.
- Employ a clean and modern layout with clear sections and intuitive navigation.
- Implement subtle animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user experience.
